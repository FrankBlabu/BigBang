# Learnings

- Planning documents should follow a consistent numbered convention (00-overview, 01-phase1, etc.) with standard sections: Objective, Implementation Details, Tests Required, Acceptance Criteria, Dependencies, Risk Assessment.
- Each planning document should include a model recommendation (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) and extended thinking flag to guide the implementing agent.
- The Pulsar project's `doc/planning/` structure serves as the reference format for BigBang planning documents.
